        <p>My name is Sonia, I come from the beautiful Italy. After some years of exploration, I ended up doing a PhD in Mathematics, or better, in Earth Science, Fluyid-Dynamics and Mathematics, at the University of Trieste. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Computational Science Center of the University of Vienna. I am looking for new opportunities, in academia and outside it. I have a (strong) background in Mathematics. I like both the pure and applied maths, I guess I am something in between (if this exists). I am able to program in Python, Matlab, in the past Java, and interested in Machine Learning and AI tools. </p>
