        <p>My name is Sonia, and I come from the beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" target="_blank">Italy</a>. After spending some years exploring different paths, I ended up doing a PhD in Mathematics, or better, in <a href="https://phd.units.it/en/dot1333212" target="_blank">Earth Science, Fluid-Dynamics and Mathematics</a>, at the <a href="https://portale.units.it/it" target="_blank">University of Trieste</a>. I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://www.csc.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">Computational Science Centre of the University of Vienna</a>.</p>

       <p>Currently, I am also looking for new job opportunities and connections. I have a background in Mathematics. Skills that I can offer: problem-solving and detail-oriented, curious, determined, and motivated. In a workplace, I value honesty and clarity, communication and good vibes. I can program in Python and Matlab (basic), in the past I experimented a bit with Java. Currently, I am interested in Machine Learning and AI tools. </p>
